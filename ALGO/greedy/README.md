# Greedy Algorithms

## Fractional knapsack

Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

- we are not allowed to break items.

- `n <- Number of items`
- `O(n)` if already sorted in non increasing order(by value to weight ratio) else
- `O(nlog(n))`

## Huffman Encoding

- `n <- Number of elements`

- O(nlog(n))

## Activity Selection Problem

- `O(nlog(n))` Time for sorting(quick_sort)
